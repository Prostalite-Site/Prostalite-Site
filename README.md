Rich in antioxidants and beneficial fatty acids, pumpkin seed extract is included to further support prostate function and urinary tract health.
Lycopene
A powerful antioxidant found in red fruits and vegetables, lycopene helps protect prostate cells from damage and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.
